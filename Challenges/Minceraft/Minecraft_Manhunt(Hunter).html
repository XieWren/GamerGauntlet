    <p>Welcome to a special two-parter, where I will be giving a guide on how to play Minecraft Manhunt, as a Hunter. Why not? It's a great way to destroy friendships forever!</p>

    <p>Now, obviously I will be pulling out all the tricks that were showcased in Dream's Minecraft Manhunt series. I will also offer some alternatives to these methods, and because I am a very fair person, disclose which methods can be countered, because I am basically doing that for the Speedrunner's perspective as well.</p>

      <h5 id="Start">Starting Out</h5>
      <p><b>Speedrunner Objectives:</b> Get as much distance as possible, and prepare.</p>
        <li><h6 id="Rush_Early">Plan A: Rush Down</h6></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The Speedrunner is currently very weak as they have no equipment. If there is more than 1 Hunter, it is a good idea for the group of Hunters to rush down the Speedrunner, smacking them with your bare fists until he is dead.</p></li>
          <li><p>The Speedrunner will know that they do not have a fair fight, and thus will lose, thus will try to get away as far as possible. If you let them get away, the game will immediately become much harder.</p></li>
          <li><p>You may worry about your <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Hunger">Hunger</a> running out, but so long as you do not attempt to boost using <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tree">Trees</a>, you should have more Hunger than the Speedrunner in the end.</p></li>
          <li><p>However, if the Speedrunner boosts with trees, he may have time to collect equipment/weapons, and this plan will fall apart. Make sure to keep a balance between the two!</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Tree Boosting</li>
          <li>Village Pillaging</li>
          <li>Lucky <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Canyon">Ravine</a></li>
          <li>Under The Sea</li>
          <li>MLG Boat/Water/Hay Bale Clutch</li>
        </ul></p>

        <li><h6 id="Lucky">Plan B: Passing a Village/Ruined Portal</h6></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Unlike other structures such as <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_pyramid">Desert</a> and <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_pyramid">Jungle Temples</a>, <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Village">Villages</a> and <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ruined_Portal">Ruined Portals</a> are usually more open than any other loot-containing structure. The Speedrunner might try to grab some loot as they pass by, if they run directly through it.</p></li>
          <li><p>Hunters have 2 options here: To grab the loot/<a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Golem">Iron Golem</a>, or to split up, with one continue chasing, hoping the Speedrunner does not enter a Blacksmith's to get a weapon upon realising there are lesser Hunters chasing them.</p></li>
          <li><p>A good practice is to only agree on splitting up after passing the Village; the Speedrunner will not be able to turn back to try to grab any loot to even the odds, as they would run into the Speedrunner still chasing them.</p></li>
          <li><p>In the event of a Ruined Portal, the Speedrunner might try to get at the chests even if you are quite close; the chests are out in the open, after all. Stop them as quickly as possible, and leave a Hunter behind again, to collect the remainder of the loot left behind.</p></li>
          <li><p>If the Speedrunner gets their hands on a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Ingot">Golden</a> <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sword">Sword</a>, have the Hunter left behind craft <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Wood">Wooden</a> Swords, or <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cobblestone">Stone</a> Swords if they have time. Unless they acquire a Golden Sword with <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sharpness">Sharpness</a>, it is still possible to take out the Speedrunner. The Hunter(s) chasing should still continue to keep the pressure on, albeit from a further distance.</p></li>
          <li><p>If they get <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Armor">Armour</a> and/or an <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Iron">Iron</a> Sword, you will have no choice but to back off, or risk getting killed. Retreat, and if you have <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bed">beds</a> from a Village, hide them nearby and set your <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn#Player_spawning">spawn</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>

          <li>Breaking and Entering</li>
          <li>Getting Lucky (Armour and Iron)</li>
        </ul></p>



      <h6 style="margin-bottom:1rem;border:black 2px solid;padding:3px;">If the plan fails and the Speedrunner gets away, prepare for the next phase of the plan. Craft a set of Iron Arnour and weapons/tools, because the Speedrunner will too. Keep an eye out for if the Speedrunner (for whatever reason) tries to engage you, especially if you know them to be in the area.</h6>



      <h5 id="Nether_Prep">Preparing for the Nether</h5>
      <p><b>Speedrunner Objective:</b> Find a lava pool, and using a Bucket, make a Nether Portal and get to the Nether.</p>
      <li><h6 id="Rush_Equipped">Plan A: Rush the Speedrunner</h6></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Math dictates that a Hunter would need to craft one set of iron armour and tools, while the Speedrunner needs to craft that and a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket">Bucket</a>, for building a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nether_portal">Nether Portal</a>. This means that you, in theory, should finish gearing up before the Speedrunner, and might be able to rush them down before they have prepared sufficiently.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the Speedrunner previously killed you, however, they might have more resources and be able to finish preparations quicker. <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Smelting">Smelting</a> time might also be an issue, so craft as many <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Furnace">Furnaces</a> as you can possibly afford, and possibly a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Blast_furnace">Blast Furnace</a>; just make sure the Speedrunner doesn't manage to steal iron from you!</p></li>
        <li><p>If you are far away, crouch when you approach the area, and hope the Speedrunner doesn't notice you. Break the first rule of Minecraft and hope you don't fall into a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lava">Lava Pit</a>, and simultaneously drop onto the Speedrunner in a circle around them, corner them and stab them to death. Simple.</p></li>
        <li><p>While most Hunters opt to dig through walls, digging through the floor is much more efficient, breaking only 1 block instead of 3. Make sure to drop down in at least 2 locations (North, South, East or West of the Speedrunner) to corner the Speedrunner more easily, before they dig into the walls and get to the surface.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Wall Mining</li>
      </ul></p>

      <li><h6 id="Ambush_Equipped">Plan B: Ambush the Speedrunner</h6></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>As seen from most of Dream's Manhunt videos, whenever the Hunters attempt to rush him down <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cave">underground</a>, he always manages to mine into the wall, relocate and/or get back to the surface. While being underground means there is a lack of space to move, this also means Dream can run away easily, as mining speed is the same for all characters, and the only way to get the <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Haste">Haste</a> effect is through a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Beacon">Beacon</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>This means that hiding in a 2-block deep hole while <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sneaking">crouching</a> on the Surface, is possibly a much better idea. For convenience however, it is a good idea to dig the hole only when you are sure the Speedrunner is coming up, and to then tower up by one block to reveal yourselves before ambushing the Speedrunner.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sure, it may be easier for them to run, but at least they can't hide or do anything! Remember, the only way for them to progress is if they managed to delay you long enough, or if they managed to take out everyone!</p></li>
        <li><p>There is one possible issue, however. There may be lava underground, which means the Speedrunner might just build a Portal there, instead of hunting for surface lava. In this case, the Speedrunner may be able to avoid the Hunters entirely.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Speedrunner could also mine around to look for lava lakes. However, the Hunters can easily notice this if the Speedrunner starts moving underground in a single general direction, by looking at their <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Player#Username">name tag</a>.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Underground Lava Lake</li>
      </ul></p>

      <li><h6 id="Overkill_1">Plan C: Full Enchanted Diamond Sets</h6></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Have a couple hunters jeep the pressure on, while the rest mine for upgrades. If you are using this plan, you will probably give the Speedrunner sufficient time to complete all their tasks in the Nether.</p></li>
        <li><p>That said, to a Speedrunner with Iron Armour, you will be basically unstoppable. Of course, if you somehow died and the Speedrunner got ahold of your equipment, you are basically screwed.</p></li>
        <li><p>(Doesn't stop Dream from countering this plan though, he's too powerful to be kept alive; interpret that how you want, stans and haters)</p></li>
      </ul>

        <li><p>Though the <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_End#Outer_islands">Outer End Islands</a> are really far away, <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Flying_machines">Flying Machines</a> can get you the Speedrunner there easily, which would mean you may have to give chase, as the Overpowered Weapons found there are no match for anything you will have found throughout the whole game.</p></li>
        <li><p>This means, if the Speedrunner chooses to travel to the Outer End Islands, you will have little choice but to follow using your own Flying Machine from as high a position as possible; the <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Elytra">Elytra</a> is too powerful.</p></li>
        <li><p>However, there is a chance that the Speedrunner will trick you if everyone, or almost everyone decides to give chase. Ender Pearls can get the Speedrunner back to the Main Island; if you aren't carrying any, you will have to fall into the Void and die and lose everything in order to get back, which is a huge disadvantage.</p></li>
        <li><p>Alternatively, you could shoot the Speedrunner down as they are travelling, so long as you don't get shot down yourself.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting Shot Off</li>
        <li>Ender Pearl U-Turn</li>
      </ul></p>

      <li><h6 id="Very_Punny">Plan E: A "Bedder" Plan</h6></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Continuing off our theme of Kamikaze, running at the Speedrunner with a Bed can easily <a class="more_info" href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-28723">blow them up</a>, especially when they are trying to take out the Ender Dragon and are in the central platform, or if they are attempting to climb an Obsidian Tower.</p></li>
        <li><p>This could easily backfire, however, if the Ender Dragon is at low health and gets (somehow) blown up before the Speedrunner did, which can be seen from the text messages informing you of that.</p></li>
      </ul>

    </ol>

    <br><h4 id="Variations">Variations</h4><hr>
    <h5 id="SvA">Speedrunner vs Assassin: Assassin (Could be Worse)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><p>In this gamemode, the Assassin(s) can take out the Speedrunner in 1 hit, but the Assasin(s) cannot move while the Speedrunner looks at them.</p></li>
      <li><p>That means the Assassin will need to hide/sneak up on the Speedrunner, in order to take out the Speedrunner.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="Save">Minecraft Mansave: Saviour (Could be Worse)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><p>In this gamemode, a Noob will try to get themselves killed in a set amount of time, optionally using a specific method, while the Saviour(s) will need to prevent them from doing so.</p></li>
      <li><p>The Saviour(s) will be given items they can use to prevent the Noob from achieving this goal, as well as Creative Mode.</p></li>
      <li><p>A good tactic is to trap the Noob to prevent them from being able to do anything.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="Manhunt_But_Technoblade">Minecraft Manhunt: Wither Edition (Could be Worse)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><p>In this gamemode, the Speedrunner will try to defeat the Wither instead of the Ender Dragon, while the Hunters try to hunt them down.</p></li>
      <li><p>This may be more time-consuming, given the rarity of <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Head#Withers">Wither Skeleton Skulls</a>. Make use of that chance, and kill every Wither Skeleton you see! Then burn the Skulls in Lava should they drop.</p></li>
      <li><p>The Wither fight will also require a lot more concentration, which could allow the Hunters to simply snipe the Speedrunner from a distance in order to win, unless underground, in which case they can easily be cornered.</p></li>
    </ul>
