    <p>Hello, hello, this is part 2 of the guide on Minecraft Manhunt, for those people who want to look cool and act as a Speedrunner. (Though honestly, Dream is in a whole league of his own.)</p>

    <p>As per the usual, I will be pulling out all the tricks that were showcased in Dream's Minecraft Manhunt series. I will also offer some possible alternatives to these methods, and because I am a very fair person, disclose which methods can be countered, because I am basically doing that for the Hunter's perspective as well.</p>

These Hunters are, in order of appearance, currently:

        <h5 id="Start">Starting Out</h5>
        <p><b>Hunter Objective:</b> Beat you to death</p>
          <li><h6 id="The_Inevitable">Plan A: Delay and Power Up</h6></li>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The main idea of this part of the manhunt, is to get equipment that the Hunters are unable to use against you, forcing them to retreat. Even a small power boost such as <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cobblestone">Stone</a>/<a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Iron">Iron</a> Weapons will work.</p></li>
            <li><p>This forces you to do things that may cause the Hunters some delay, such as <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Boat">Boat</a> Clutches, or using <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Hay_Bale">Hay Bales</a>, to jump off a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Terrain_features#Mountain">Mountain</a>.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Being unlucky; the starting point is always the hardest</li>
          </ul></p>

          <li><h6 id="Sebastian">Plan B: Under The Sea</h6></li>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Remember how, in all the Minecraft Manhunt videos, whenever Dream is in danger of dying, all the animals rush to his aid, like a Disney Princess in need?</p></li>
            <li><p>Well, if you pass an <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ocean">Ocean</a>, you can jump in and <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Swimming">swim</a>; swim speed is difficult to change, and you get some time to think, as <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Hunger">Hunger</a> depletes very slowly; its almost negligible.</p></li>
            <li><p>Except for one: <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dolphin">Dolphins</a> give the <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dolphin's_Grace">Dolphin's Grace</a> Buff, which lets you swim faster. If you are the first person in the water, all the Dolphins should be attracted to you, allowing you to leave the Hunters behind.</p></li>
            <li><p>However, if there is a lack of Dolphins in the vicinity, the Hunters may be able to craft Boats to eventually catch up; if you realise they are doing this, get to the land as soon as possible, upgrade in whatever way you can in those few seconds, and repeat.</p></li>
            <li><p>Preferably, you can craft more Boats.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>No Dolphins</li>
          </ul></p>

          <li><h6 id="Robbery">Plan C: Breaking and Entering</h6></li>
          <ul>
            <li><p>If you pass a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Village">Village</a> or <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ruined_Portal">Ruined Portal</a> that is easy to loot (as opposed to <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_pyramid">Jungle</a> and <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_pyramid">Desert Temples</a>), it might be a good idea to get as much as you can; the Hunters may be distracted and split up to prevent you from getting much, which might let you pick them off.</p></li>
            <li><p>Think of it like this: If you don't try to get anything, they will get something anyways.</p></li>
            <li><p>If it's a Village you pass, you will want to get Hay Bales for <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bread">Bread</a> and Fall Damage Prevention, or to a Blacksmith for some Iron Gear. Break the <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glass_Pane">windows</a> to get items as opposed to going in; you will be easily cornered.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Persistent Hunters, in which case you just have to keep going</li>
          </ul></p>

          <li><h6 id="Lucky_Break">Plan D: The Ravine</h6></li>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Alternatively, there are a lot of ways to incapacitate the Hunters to such a degree that they are forced to back off. A naturally generated <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Canyon">ravine</a> on the surface is a prime example.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you do not have <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block">blocks</a>, you could try to push the Hunters into the ravine.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you do have blocks however, possibly using one of the earlier methods, you could block the Hunters as they attempt to jump across the ravine after you, causing them to plummet to their deaths.</p></li>
            <li><p>Alternatively, if you jump into <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Water">water</a> at the bottom, the Hunters are likely to come after you. Placing blocks above the water surface after they jump can cause them to possibly take fatal fall damage.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Going Around</li>
            <li>Staying a Distance</li>
            <li>Bows</li>
            <li>Boat Clutch, MLG Water Bucket, Hay Bales</li>
          </ul></p>



        <h6 style="margin-bottom:1rem;border:black 2px solid;padding:3px;">Now that you have, for the time being at least, shaken the Hunters off your tail, they are going to gear up, knowing that you will too. Prepare well, but don't dally. If they get to you before you are done, you may not escape.</h6>



        <h5 id="Nether_Maybe">To the Nether!</h5>
        <p><b>Hunter Objective:</b> Gear up to your level, then come after you</h6></li>
        <li><h6 id="Wall_Mining">Plan A: Wall Mining</h6></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>If you hear mining, or see the Hunter's <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Player#Username">name tags</a>, mine up all your <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Furnace">Furnaces</a> and <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Table">Crafting Table</a>. Ensure you crafted a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket">bucket</a>; you will need it for the <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nether_portal">Nether Portal</a>.</p></li>
          <li><p>If the Hunters have not spotted you yet, it would be a good idea to mine into the walls to escape.</p></li>
          <li><p>Alternatively, you can attack them from above, possibly with <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lava">Lava</a>, if you don't mind revealing you have noticed them.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Surface Ambush</li>
        </ul></p>

        <li><h6 id="Pentagram">Plan B: Underground Portal</h6></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>If there is underground lava nearby, it is a good idea to create a Nether Portal underground. This is a good way to avoid being ambushed on the surface.</p></li>
          <li><p>However, this will give you the 'Hot Stuff' <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Advancement#List_of_advancements">Advancement</a>, which can alert the Hunters that you are going to the Nether, and they might come after you.</p></li>
          <li><p>Getting out of the Nether alive later on may become a concern. Spawning a Portal underground might mean having to dig out, or to navigate many tunnels when getting out, especially if the Hunters try to go after you.</p></li>
          <li><p>Thus, this should be a plan that should be carried out only when you are sure the Hunters aren't around to get you.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Can be countered by:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting Cornered</li>
          <li>Terrain Difficulties</li>
        </ul></p>



        <h6 style="margin-bottom:1rem;border:black 2px solid;padding:3px;">Well, you are in the Nether now. This is the bit where you are more likely to get yourself killed, than for the hunters to kill you. You better have Fire Resistance!</h6>



        <h5 id="We_Need_To_Go_Deeper">On the hunt for a Nether Fortress</h5>
        <p><b>Hunter Objective:</b> Burn you in a lava lake <br>

        <li><h6 id="BloonsTD">Plan A: Literal Tower Defence</h6></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>If and when the Hunters catch up to you in the <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nether">Nether</a>, you are more likely to get cornered at the edge of a Lava Lake, than to be directly taken out by the Hunters. They are counting on that happening, actually.</p></li>
          <li><p>You can decide on either of the following options while the Hunters try to get to you:
          <p> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wall Mining:</span><br>

        <li><p>Tip: If the Assassin is in water, looking at them will cause them to stop swimming, and eventally <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#Drowning">drown</a> to death. Remember! The water is your best friend!</p></li>

      <h5 id="What_My_Tutor_Will_Call_Me">Minecraft Mansave: Noob (Could be Worse)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Noob Objective:</b> Get themselves killed</p></li>
        <li><p>In this gamemode, a Noob will try to get themselves killed in a set amount of time, optionally using a specific method, while the Saviour(s) will need to prevent them from doing so.</p></li>
        <li><p>If choosing a specific way to die, it may be a good idea to make it not as obvious what the method is.</p></li>
        <li><p>For example, instead of waiting for <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Daylight_cycle#Nighttime">nighttime</a>, one can go underground to get blown up by a <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Creeper">Creeper</a>; the Saviours might mistake you for trying to burn yourself in lava.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h5 id="Manhunt_But_Technoblade">Minecraft Manhunt: Wither Edition (Massive Luck Required)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><p>In this gamemode, the Speedrunner will try to defeat the Wither instead of the Ender Dragon, while the Hunters try to hunt them down.</p></li>
        <li><p>This may be more time-consuming, given the rarity of <a class="more_info" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Head#Withers">Wither Skeleton Skulls</a>. The Speedrunner will have to be more patient and survive for a lot longer in the Nether.</p></li>
        <li><p>The Wither will also actively attempt to target players (usually impartially), as opposed to the Ender Dragon who... just flies around? Either way, the fight will be a lot harder without proper gear, unless underground.</p></li>
      </ul>
